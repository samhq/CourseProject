## PBSE: Personalized Bookmark Search Engine

Most, if not all modern internet browsers such as Google Chrome offer a bookmark feature that allows users to retain website URLs for future reference. This makes it very convenient for users to access their favourite websites. However, as a bookmark list grows larger over time, users will have a hard time searching through it to find the relevant contents they want. Moreover, there isn't a way to search into the contents of those bookmarks as a bookmark only contains the URL and title of a particular web page. Thus, we are proposing a personalized bookmark search engine to address these shortcomings.
